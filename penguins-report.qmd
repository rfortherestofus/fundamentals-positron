# Introduction

This report is about **three** species of penguins

1.  Adele
2.  Gentoo
3.  Chinstrap

You'll learn *so* much about the penguins. I hope you're ready!

# Results

Here is a chart showing the average bill length for penguins, grouped by island and sex.

```{r}
penguin_bill_length_by_island_and_sex <-
  penguins |>
  drop_na(sex) |>
  group_by(island, sex) |>
  summarize(mean_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm))

ggplot(
  data = penguin_bill_length_by_island_and_sex,
  mapping = aes(
    x = island,
    y = mean_bill_length,
    fill = sex
  )
) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```
